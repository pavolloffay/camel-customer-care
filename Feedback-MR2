Concerning wiretap log mail: don't split & concat -> better in DSL like in slides

set header in mailprocessor - dedicated field for name --> exchange.filenameonly (filename without path)

date in businessmodel+xml --> already done in dropbox branch

why class spamfilter static?

rather bean binding like spamfilter class, not instatiate processors

bean mode: manipulate headers

bean: return body

command queue

json close, comment + text, push to queue, client reads from queue

next MR pre last week in June (Wednesday)
